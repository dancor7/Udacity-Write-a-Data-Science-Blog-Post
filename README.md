This is the repo of the Write a Data Science Blog Post project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project.

We investigated if North America was a better place to immigrate rather then Europe for a software developer. This is a question close to my heart since my country is unstable at the moment an immigration is always a choice.

The data comes from the stack overflow 2017 survey. I included the zip file with the survey_results_public.csv file that is used as the data. We used numpy and pandas for data wrangling, matplotlib and seaborn to plot our graphs and the warnings library to avoid warnings from staining the code.

In the end, we discovered that with the data we have, North America is the best choice, with the highest salary.
